# ðŸ¤– Learning Microsoft AutoGen

This repo contains a few simple experiments and notes from my exploration of [Microsoft's AutoGen framework](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), which is designed for building multi-agent systems using LLMs.

These examples are based on official tutorials and documentation. My goal was to get a feel for how AutoGen structures agent interactions, manages context, and integrates tools/humans into LLM workflows.
